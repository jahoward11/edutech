> A reader lives a thousand lives before he dies. The man who never reads lives only one.  
> —Sir George Henry Martin (1926-2016)

> The most technologically efficient machine that man has ever invented is the book.  
> —Herman Northrop Frye (1912-1991)

> Fantasy is escapist, and that is its glory. If a soldier is imprisioned by the enemy, don’t we consider it his duty to escape?. . .If we value the freedom of mind and soul, if we’re partisans of liberty, then it’s our plain duty to escape, and to take as many people with us as we can!  
> —J.R.R. Tolkien (1892-1973)
